         * In this example, we'll explore what "simulation" means, and how to use it.
         * 
         * In a data flow graph, execution flow is split into two parts: simulation and rendering.
         * Simulation is event based, and it's purpose is to do everything needed to set the graph up for rendering.
         * This can include:
         * - Ingesting data / events from the game
         * - Handling updating of nodes
         * - Creating / destroying nodes and connections
         * - Flowing messages
         * - Updating "time" (usually)
         * 
         * Later on, we'll explore exactly what "rendering" means but for now, just think of it as the a processing counterpart
         * to the event-based processing happening in the simulation.
         * 
         * The simulation's purpose is, in large part, to prepare and rig the graph for fast execution in the rendering 
         * phase, where everything is immutable, except for the flowing data.
         * Thus, simulation can be viewed as progressing the setup of the graph between rendering invocations. In the same way, you
         * can simulate a data flow graph without actually rendering it. Or you can render it, without simulating it 
         * further.
         * 
         * Concretely in this example, we'll just explore updating a node and a set.
