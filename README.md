# Instructions
Using this package is quite simple:
- Start a fresh new Unity project in 2019.3 or later
- Open the [Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@latest/index.html) window.
- Click the "**+**" drop-down menu in the upper left corner.
- Choose "Add package from git URL...".
- Type in "com.unity.dataflowgraph" and press Enter.


# Where to Start
The best resource for getting started are the Samples included with the package.  These are available through the Package Manager UI by selecting DataFlowGraph and scrolling to the bottom of its description.  There you will find options to import the "Guided Tour in Code" as well as some simple "Examples".

As of now there is very little formal high level documentation, however, all APIs are fully documented and most features are covered in the aforementioned "Guided Tour in Code".  The documentation is available through the Package Manager UI by selecting DataFlowGraph and clicking "View documentation".
